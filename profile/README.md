Configuration Management for an Audio production environment

### Workflow orchestration

> Orchestration is about bringing together disparate things into a coherent whole. In the classical sense, you’ve got strings, brass, woodwinds and percussion, all with their own separate sheet music, with a conductor at the helm to ensure organization and timing in order to produce harmony instead of cacophony.... Once you’ve orchestrated and arranged your musical composition, it becomes available for anyone to use at any level



[^1]: [Open music](https://open-music.org/about) is music available in "source code" form, encourages derivative works and is free of cost for non-commercial use.
