# :musical_score:	Syncopated Linux

A Linux distribution for Open Music [^1]

Within it a selection of well designed and reasonably interesting FOSS applications intended for Musicians, Composers, Audio Engineers and Tinkerers alike.

A fork of [ArchLabs](https://archlabslinux.com) is used as the foundation. ArchLabs is a stable and minimal distribution well suited for the purposes of this project.


[^1]: [Open music](https://open-music.org/) is music that is shareable, available in "source code" form, allows derivative works and is free of cost for non-commercial use. It is the concept of "open source" computer software applied to music. Which is odd...as in a sense, "Music" itself would be an example of something created using an open source language.
