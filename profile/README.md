# :musical_score:	Syncopated Linux

a Linux distribution intended for Audio Engineering and Open Music[^1] production within an collective studio ecosystem.

a fork of [ArchLabs](https://archlabslinux.com) Syncopated adds to it a selection of some reasonably interesting FOSS applications intended for Musicians, Composers, Audio Engineers and Tinkerers alike.



[^1]: Open music is music that is shareable, available in "source code" form, allows derivative works and is free of cost for non-commercial use. It is the concept of "open source" computer software applied to music. Which is odd as in a sense, "Music" itself would be an example of something created using an open source language.
