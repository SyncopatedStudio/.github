# :musical_score:	SyncopatedOS

SyncopatedOS is a Linux distribution for Audio and Music production.

Syncopated can be used by Audio production engineers working with musicians to develop sound
that can be reproducable in other environments.

> A build is reproducible if given the same source code, build environment and build instructions, 
any party can recreate bit-by-bit identical copies of all specified artifacts. [^1]
