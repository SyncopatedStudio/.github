# :musical_score:	Syncopated Linux

a Linux distribution intended for Audio and Music production within a studio ecosystem.

Syncopated is a fork of [ArchLabs](https://archlabslinux.com) which adds to it a selection of some reasonably interesting FOSS applications intended for:

* Musicians
* Composers
* Audio Engineers
* Tinkerers 

Open music[^1] is music that is shareable, available in "source code" form, allows derivative works and is free of cost for non-commercial use. It is the concept of "open source" computer software applied to music.
