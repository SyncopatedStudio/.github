# :musical_score:	Syncopated Linux

A Linux distribution for Open Music [^1]

Within it a selection of well designed and reasonably interesting FOSS applications intended for Musicians, Composers, Audio Engineers and Tinkerers alike.

A fork of [ArchLabs](https://archlabslinux.com) is used as the foundation. ArchLabs is a stable and minimal distribution well suited for the purposes of this project.


[^1]: [Open music](https://open-music.org/about) is music available in "source code" form, encourages derivative works and is free of cost for non-commercial use.
